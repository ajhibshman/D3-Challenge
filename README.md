# D3-Challenge

In this excersize, I plotted various measurements by state on a scatterplot utilizing javascript, html and d3.js
This was then deployed to my github pages.

In the first plot, percent of population lacking healthcare was plotted against income by state.

for the bonus excersize, the user may select options for each axis, the plot then regenerates proper scaling and replots the data.
